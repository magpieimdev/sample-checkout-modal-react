# Accept a payment with Magpie Checkout

This integration shows you how to accept payments with Magpie Checkout.

Building a payment form UI from scratch is difficult -- input field
validation, error message handing, and localization are just a few things
to think about when designing a simple checkout flow.

We built Checkout to do that
work for you so now you can focus on building the best storefront
experience for your customers.

Once your customer is ready to pay, use checkout.js to open the Magpie hosted Checkout dialog. ðŸ¥³

## Demo

[https://sample-magpie-checkout-app.herokuapp.com](https://sample-magpie-checkout-app.herokuapp.com/)

The demo is running in test mode -- use `4242 4242 4242 4242` as a test card number with any CVC + future expiration date.

Read more about testing on Magpie at [https://magpie.im/documentation/#section/Test-Cards](https://magpie.im/documentation/#section/Test-Cards).

## How to run locally

**Installing and cloning manually**

```
git clone https://github.com/magpieimdev/sample-checkout-modal-react.git
```

Rename and move the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file into a file named
`.env` in the root folder. For example:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Example `.env` file:

```sh
REACT_APP_MAGPIE_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
```

You will need a Magpie merchant account in order to run the demo. Once you set up
your account, go to the Magpie [developer
dashboard](https://dashboard.magpie.im/dashboard/developer/keys) to find your API
keys.
